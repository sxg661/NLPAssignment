I <speaker>will</speaker> present joint work with Jong-Shi Pang and <speaker>Grace Lo</speaker> (Johns Hopkins
University) and <speaker>Sandra Sudarsky</speaker> (<speaker>Texas A</speaker>&M University) on the
multi-rigid-body contact problem, which we state as follows:  given a set of
bodies with multiple concurrent contacts, determine the instantaneous
accelerations of the bodies and the contact forces (if possible).  <paragraph><sentence>The
bodies are assumed to be rigid.</sentence>  <sentence>Contacts are assumed to be distributed over
locally planar patches (which <speaker>may shrink</speaker> to a point).</sentence>  <sentence>Friction forces are
assumed to obey the maximum work inequality.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Several natural complementary relationships exists between the unknown
contact forces and accelerations.</sentence>  <sentence>For example, the product of the normal
components of the contact force and relative acceleration at a contact must
be zero.</sentence>  <sentence>We have formulated the general multi-rigid-body contact problem as
linear and nonlinear complementarity problems and employed tools from the
theories of quasi-variational inequalities and complementarity problems to
prove new existence and uniqueness results.</sentence>  <sentence>These new results apply as long
as the friction model at each contact obeys the maximum work inequality.</sentence>
<sentence><speaker>Thus</speaker> the results apply when contacts are assumed to be isolated points with
isotropic or anisotropic Coulomb friction as well as the more general limit
surface descriptions proposed by <speaker>Goyal</speaker> and <speaker>Howe</speaker> and <speaker>Cutkosky</speaker>.</sentence></paragraph>
