 Title: 	<speaker>Green Engineering</speaker>: Rethinking Engineering Design And  
 	Manufacturing From The Environmental Perspective.

<paragraph><sentence><speaker>Green Engineering</speaker> is an approach to product and process design that
achieves environmental friendliness without compromising a product's quality or its commercial viability.</sentence>  <sentence>The implications of green engineering are far reaching.</sentence> <sentence>Product design has to now include issues relating to disposal and reuse.</sentence> <sentence>Manufacturing has to include disassembly and remanufacture (de-manufacturing).</sentence> <sentence>Economic planning has to include revenues from post consumer marketing.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence><speaker>Over</speaker> the past two decades, a lot of research and effort has been put
into understanding issues such as waste management and materials recovery, as they relate to products after they enter the waste stream.</sentence>  <sentence>Attention is now being focussed on the product design.</sentence>  <sentence>Our idea is to inject concerns about environmental friendliness into the design process, where, the assessment of environmental friendliness is based on a life-cycle view of the product.</sentence>  <sentence>This includes the product's manufacturing process, distribution, use, and final disposal.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>This talk provides an overview of the "Design for Environment" effort at CMU.</sentence> <sentence>Including the role of robotics, CAD tools and environmental analysis.</sentence> <sentence>This research grew out of work in traditional concurrent engineering and was called the <speaker><speaker>Green Engineering</speaker> <speaker>Project</speaker></speaker> in 1989.</sentence>  <sentence>The project has concentrated on the engineering and economic issues of being environmentally compatible.</sentence></paragraph>
