     The  <speaker>speaker will describe</speaker> his rather unexpected experiences as a
     mere technologist in the corridors of  power  in  <speaker>Washington</speaker>.  By
     being  in  the  right place at the right time, he was selected as
     co-chair of the White House Information  Technology  Task  <speaker>Force</speaker>,
     which   was   tasked   during  the  early  days  of  the  Clinton
     Administration  to  recommend  a  new  computer  system  for  the
     Executive  <speaker>Office</speaker>  of  the  President.    His experiences include
     bringing  the  Internet  to  the  White  House  and  establishing
     Internet   accounts   for   the   President  and  Vice  President
     (president,vice.president@whitehouse.gov), participating  on  the
     Vice  President's  National  Performance  Review  to  re-engineer
     government through information technology, almost  knocking  over
     the President with a laserprinter, and inspecting the fiber optic
     network on board Air <speaker>Force</speaker> One.
