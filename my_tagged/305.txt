 TITLE:  <speaker>Dante II</speaker> and <speaker>Beyond</speaker>: Exploration Robots

In the summer of 1994, <speaker>Dante II</speaker> successfully descended into the crater
of an active Alaskan volcano using a combination of walking and
rappelling locomotion. <paragraph><sentence>While linked by satellite to a very remote base
station, Dante relied on a suite of sensors and semi-autonomous
operational modes to traverse the very challenging terrain.</sentence> <sentence>Once at
the crater floor, fumarole gas data and detailed video images in
addition to high resolution laser-built terrain reconstructions were
viewed live by scientists in several US locations.</sentence> <sentence>During its ascent
out of the crater, Dante tipped over while attempting to climb a steep
side slope of <speaker>muddy ash</speaker> and had to be recovered.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence><speaker>Much</speaker> was learned in this fast-paced, high risk research project in
areas ranging from robot configuration to telepresence control to
field operations and logistics.</sentence>  <sentence>One measure of the success of the
<speaker><speaker>Dante II</speaker> research</speaker> is the degree by which the lessons learned can be
articulated, communicated and applied to future generations of
exploration robots.</sentence></paragraph>
