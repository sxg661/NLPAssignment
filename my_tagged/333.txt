   RISC in a robotics context stands for Reduced Intricacy in Sensing and
   Control.  <sentence>But it shares the same philosophy as RISC computer design.</sentence>
   The idea is to replace complicated manipulation and sensing steps with
   combinations of simple ones.  Industrial robotics research has focussed
   on anthropomorphism in the <speaker>hope</speaker> that once robots become sufficiently
   human-like, they <speaker>will</speaker> be able to solve all the tasks that they are
   currently incapable of doing.  This approach is seductive and has led
   researchers further and further away from the real problems that
   hinder the proliferation of robots in manufacturing.  The enthusiasm
   for robotics in industry which reached a peak in the mid 80's has all
   but disappeared after a protracted lack of progress on these problems.

   As <speaker>Whitney</speaker> [1] and others have argued, even if robots with human-like
   dexterity and flexibility could be built, and they are clearly decades
   away, they <speaker>will</speaker> be completely impractical economically.  The problem
   is that robots, at least in an industrial setting, need more dexterity
   and sensing capability than they have today, but far less than a human
   being.  <sentence>We are trying a RISC approach to achieving this capability.</sentence>  We
   achieve complicated manipulation and sensing performance by using
   *just enough* simple elements, namely:

	 * Dextrous manipulation is replaced by two or three
	   transfer/grasping steps with simple, specialized grippers.

	 * Dense sensor input like vision or tactile or rangefinder 
	   data is replaced by very low resolution sensors, like finger gap,
	   optical beam or low-resolution tactile.

   This lets us build fast, cheap, simple, robust systems now rather than
   later.  The sensors are small and inexpensive enough that they can be
   placed throughout the environment, including on every gripper, so that
   each operation can be monitored throughout a task.

   This talk <speaker>will</speaker> give an overview of the approach, and some of the new
   research problems that it suggests.  Then we <speaker><speaker>will</speaker> describe</speaker> some recent
   results on beam sensing.  In particular, we find that processing beam
   data provides object recognition times in milliseconds rather than
   minutes, and much finer localization than is possible with vision.  If
   a sensor provides few accurate values (rather than an enormous number
   of inaccurate ones as with vision), recognition reduces to a hash
   table lookup.
