Abstract: 


			The <speaker>TERA Computer System</speaker>
		             Burton J. <speaker>Smith</speaker>

 		       Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center
                          Mellon Institute Bldg.
			Third Floor Conference Room             
				Oct 11, <stime>4:00 p.m</stime>.

<paragraph><sentence>(If you don't know where this room is, meet at <stime>3:45 p.m</stime>.</sentence> <sentence>at the 5th floor 
entrance and we can walk over together.)</sentence></paragraph>

          <sentence>The <speaker>TERA Computer System</speaker> is a scalable shared memory MIMD computer.</sentence>
	  Although it has no vector instructions, the 256 processor version
	  <speaker>will</speaker> have peak performance of about 300 GFLOPS.  The arithmetic
	  <speaker>will</speaker> conform to IEEE standard 754.  The system's I/O cache, used 
	  with disk arrays, <speaker>will</speaker> enable file system bandwidths of 70
	  gigabytes per second or more.  The languages available <speaker>will</speaker> be
	  Fortran 77, C and C++, and the programming environment <speaker>will</speaker> support
	  a mixture of explicit programmer-generated and aggressive compiler-
	  generated parallelism.  Tools <speaker>will</speaker> be provided to help users 
	  re-engineer programs for parallel execution and to debug optimized,
	  parallelized code.  A 16-processor system <speaker>will</speaker> be available for
	  customer benchmarking in first quarter 1991.  First system 
	  deliveries are scheduled for fourth quarter <speaker>1993</speaker>.

	  The talk <speaker>will</speaker> describe the overall architecture of the system and
	  its hardware implementation; the programming environment and
	  associated tools; the operating system, including the file system;
	  and the company's status and long-range plans.

Burton <speaker>Smith</speaker> is the president of <speaker>Tera Inc</speaker>.   <sentence>Previously, he was the chief
architect of the HEP computer, a "barrel processor" introduced in the mid
80's.
