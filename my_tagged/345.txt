 TITLE:	Learning Control for Improved Performance in 
 	Repetitive Robot Operations

Learning control refers to control systems that can learn from previous 
experience performing a specific task, in order to improve their performance 
in future executions of the task. <paragraph><sentence>Although there are some precursors, the filed 
started in 1984 with several researchers on different continents (including 
<speaker>Professor</speaker> Longman, then Australia) addressing the problem of improving control 
system performance for robots performing repetitive tasks on assembly lines.</sentence> 
<sentence>The talk <speaker>will</speaker> give an overview of learning control strategies that make use of 
control theory concepts to accomplish their learning.</sentence></paragraph>
