          <speaker>The Role</speaker> of <speaker>Visual Fidelity</speaker> in Instructional Simulations

The Software Engineering Institute made use of digital video in developing an
interactive course teaching code inspections, a formalized group process for
finding defects in software code.  <paragraph><sentence>This course, titled "<speaker>A Cure</speaker> for the Common
Code", is interactive in that the student not only learns about but also
participates in code inspections.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Digital video systems offer a wide spectrum of interface capabilities,
allowing the <speaker>fidelity</speaker> of "<speaker>A Cure</speaker> for the Common Code" to vary from that of a
home arcade game with simple graphics and slide show presentations to a
<speaker>visually rich display</speaker> complete with full motion video.</sentence>  <sentence>Photographic
images of an office setting and professional video of actors playing the
roles of fellow workers can make the learning environment both engaging
and realistic to the student.</sentence>  <sentence>However, is there any instructional
benefit to increasing the <speaker>visual <speaker>fidelity</speaker></speaker> of the environment?</sentence>  "<speaker>A Cure</speaker>
for the Common Code" was used in a formal experiment to address this
question, and more specifically to address the following:

  - what role does the frame rate of visual material play in the students'
    perception of and ability to recall presented information?

  - does the use of surrogate travel, rather than a single image, 
    point-and-click navigation interface, have any effect on student 
    recall and perception of presented material?

<sentence>This talk <speaker>will briefly overview</speaker> the code inspection course, and then discuss
the results of the <speaker>formal experiment concerning <speaker>visual <speaker>fidelity</speaker></speaker></speaker> in interfaces.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>This work is among the first to explore the unique interface opportunities
which digital video offers, and a set of <speaker>guidelines will</speaker> be proposed based
upon this research.</sentence></paragraph>

Michael <speaker>Christel</speaker> has been a member of the technical staff at the Software
Engineering Institute for the past six years.  <paragraph><sentence>From <speaker>1987</speaker> to 1990 he worked on
the Advanced Learning Technologies (ALT) <speaker>Project</speaker> at the SEI, creating a
digital video code inspection course.</sentence>  <sentence>He has since worked on projects
exploring the use of multimedia for requirements elicitation, and improving
the utility of large multimedia databases for both software engineering tools
and training.</sentence>  <speaker>Christel</speaker> has authored numerous papers on the ALT <speaker>Project</speaker>,
multimedia, and software engineering, including articles on the use of digital

video and rule bases for training simulations, and the implementation of
virtual reality systems on personal computers.  <sentence>He has given a number of
invited talks on digital video, multimedia for software engineering
instruction, and multimedia interface issues.</sentence>  <sentence><speaker>Christel</speaker> received his Ph.D.
from the <speaker>Georgia Institute</speaker> of Technology in the area of human computer
interaction, focusing on practical implications for the development of
multimedia interfaces for educational applications.</sentence></paragraph>
