       <speaker>D</speaker>ynamic Simulation of and Experiments in 
   Compliant Control of Threaded Fastener Insertion
********************************************************

<speaker>According</speaker> to a study by <speaker>Nevins</speaker> and <speaker><speaker>Whitney</speaker> [</speaker>1] the insertion and tightening
of threaded fasteners is one of the most common assembly tasks, yet little
published work has considered the type of control best suited for the
assembly of threaded parts.  <paragraph><sentence>This talk <speaker>will discuss</speaker> a dynamic simulation and
confirmatory experiments conducted to investigate compliant control
techniques that guarantee proper insertion under positioning uncertainty.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Armed with an explicit function description of the parts, Euler's equations,
and assumptions about impulsive forces we have created a fully dynamic
simulation of the insertion of threaded fasteners under stiffness, damping,
and accomodation control.</sentence>  <sentence>Points of contact between the parts are
determined and tracked during the simulation.</sentence>  <sentence>Reaction forces are computed
based on the contact locations and velocity constraints.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>To validate the simulation a high precision robot equipped with a force and
torque sensor carried out insertions under force-feedback control.</sentence>  <sentence>The
experimental results are compared to the simulation.</sentence>  <sentence>Based on the
experiments and simulation, control solutions are presented for various
regions of uncertainty in positioning.</sentence></paragraph>
