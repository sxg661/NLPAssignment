	Logical Interpretations and Computational Simulations
			   <speaker>Tim Griffin</speaker>
      		      AT&<speaker>T Bell Laboratories</speaker>

	There are many examples in the literature of mathematical 
	logic concerning the interpretation of one logical system 
	in another. <sentence>From a perspective informed by the 
	formulae-as-types correspondence, it is natural to 
	investigate logical interpretations from a computational 
	point of view.</sentence>     <sentence>Of particular interest are logical 
	interpretations that can be associated with simulations 
	of one computational system in another.</sentence> 

	<sentence>The talk surveys several results of this kind, including 
	interpretations of classical logic in constructive logic 
	that can be associated with ``continuation passing style'' 
	transformations.</sentence> <sentence>These transformations simulate a functional 
	language extended with control operators in a purely 
	functional language.</sentence> 	

 NOTE: <speaker>Tim Griffin</speaker> will be here Thursday afternoon and all day Friday 6 Dec.
