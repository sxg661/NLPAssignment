	  Observations on Massively Parallel Processors and
	     a <speaker>Case</speaker> for a New Theoretical Model: LogP

Just a few years ago I doubted that massively parallel processors (MPP) 
and software would ever converge on a common foundation, which is 
absolutely essential if MPP is to become popular. <sentence>Today I can <speaker>see</speaker> that 
convergence, with a machine operating 1000 times faster than the
fastest Cray computer being feasible in just a few years.</sentence>  <sentence>Now I am 
concerned whether computer science in general (and computer 
science theory in particular) will take advantage of this opportunity
to contribute to and accelerate the success of massive parallelism.</sentence> 

<sentence>This talk <speaker>will first</speaker> relay my (possibly controversial) observations:
1: We really can get to 1 TeraFLOPS(Million MFLOPS)!</sentence> <sentence>And Soon!</sentence>
<sentence>2: Computer science has an obligation as well as an opportunity in MPP.</sentence>
<sentence>3: MPP hardware organizations are converging, and early guesses at MPP 
	issues were wrong.</sentence>
<sentence>4: Topology based models are not relevant for machines and software of the 90s.</sentence>
<sentence>5: Current theoretical models (i.e., PRAM) may be too inaccurate to expect 
	them to lead to important contributions in MPP.</sentence></paragraph>

<sentence>This is followed by an introduction to a more realistic model, called "LogP,"
developed by architects and theoreticians at <speaker>Berkeley</speaker>.</sentence> The name LogP comes
from the four parameters of the model:

 L: Latency of communication in the network.
 o: Overhead for the processor to send or receive a message from the network.
 g: Gap between consecutive messages sent or received at a processor.
 P: number of processor/memory modules.
