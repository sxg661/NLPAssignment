                  Foundations of Nonholonomic Motion Planning

    In this talk, I <speaker><speaker>will</speaker> first</speaker> summarize applications of Nonholonomic
    Motion Planning (NMP) to dextrous manipulation or assembly with a
    robotic hand, parking a vehicle with/without trailers, attitude
    control of a satellite using rotors or solar panel positioners,
    reconfiguration of a space structure (e.g., a space-station or a
    space platform/manipulator system) using internal motion and
    maneuvering in mid-air by a spring-board diver, a gymnast and a
    <speaker>falling cat</speaker>.  Then, I <speaker><speaker>will</speaker> describe</speaker> the nature of nonholonomic
    constraints or nonintegrable conservation laws associated with
    each of the above systems and the formulation of nonholonomic
    motion planning problems.  I <speaker>will</speaker> show that a NMP problem is
    equivalent to the constructive nonlinear controllability problem
    of a nonlinear control system without drift.  I <speaker>will</speaker> also look at
    the existence of a motion problem for a NMP problem and highlight
    several new results we have obtained.  <speaker>Finally</speaker>, I <speaker>will</speaker> present a
    simple but effective algorithm, called the Basis Algorithm, for
    computing near optimal solutions of a NMP problem, togther with
    simulation results. A simulation package implementing the Basis
    Algorithm <speaker>will</speaker> be discussed if time permits.
