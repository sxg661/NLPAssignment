               Supercomputer  Interconnection Networks

     Multistage interconnection networks (<speaker>MINs</speaker>) form the backbone
     of  traditional vector supercomputers.  First, an historical
     perspective of <speaker>MINs</speaker> in vector supercomputers is given.  This
     is  followed  by  the  description  of  an on-going study of
     large-scale vector-oriented  <speaker>MINs</speaker>.  An  accurate  simulation
     model is described.  Performance results are then presented;
     these results are focused on determining the relative impor-
     tance of several <speaker>MIN characteristics</speaker>.

Jim <speaker>Smith</speaker> was formerly with the University of Wisconsin where he developed
the concept of the "Decoupled Access/Execute Architectures".  <sentence>He then went
on to build such a machine, the ZS-1, for the Astronautics Corp. of <speaker>America</speaker>.</sentence>
<sentence>After <speaker>Seymour Cray</speaker> left to form Cray Computer, he joined Cray Research as
computer architect.</sentence>  <sentence>The <speaker>abstract may</speaker> sound a little dry, but I think the
talk <speaker>will</speaker> not disappoint you, especially if you wonder what is happening in
this part of the supercomputer world [I don't want to <speaker>say</speaker> more; Cray
Research after all is the company that developed the Cray X-MP and the 
Cray Y-MP.]</sentence>  --TRG
