 TITLE:	Elemental measurements in vision.

<paragraph><sentence>What are the "elements" of early vision?</sentence> <sentence>I <speaker><speaker>will</speaker> discuss</speaker> a unifying framework under which the basic visual measurements can be derived in a consistent manner.</sentence>  <sentence>First we must consider the structure of the
light in which a visual organism is immersed; this <speaker>may</speaker> be formalized with the "plenoptic function," which is related to Gibson's concept of the optic array.</sentence>  <sentence>Derivative operators on this function produce measurements of form, motion, color, flicker, disparity, and so on.</sentence> <sentence>We can derive a kind of periodic table of early vision.</sentence></paragraph>

<sentence>I <speaker>will</speaker> also discuss some of our work on early vision using "steerable filters" and "steerable pyramids" to analyze orientation, scale, local energy, and so on.</sentence>  The steerable pyramid has advantages over other multiscale image decompositions -- including the currently popular orthogonal wavelet transforms.
