Abstract: 


                                  SEMINAR

    The Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) is hosting a seminar titled:

        ***Computational Materials Science:  <speaker>The <speaker>Dawn</speaker></speaker> of a New Age***

                                presented by
                             <speaker>Arthur J</speaker>.  Freeman
                     Department of Physics and Astronomy
                           Northwestern University

Advances in computational electronic structure methods combined with those in
computer hardware (and software) have led to the development of a new branch
of materials science- computational materials science.  <paragraph><sentence>In the <speaker>dawn</speaker> of this 
new age, impressive starts have already been made to understand the complexity 
of real materials with their intriguing interplay between the underlying
chemical, physical and structural properties.</sentence>  <sentence>This talk illustrates several 
areas addressed recently, particularly at PSC.</sentence></paragraph>

                         Date:   Friday, <speaker>September</speaker> 16, 1994

                         Time:   4 p.m.
