In the course of implementing two languages simultaneously, we recently faced
the prospect of building two garbage collectors. <sentence>We turned laziness into a
virtue and considered the problem of designing a framework and garbage
collector components that could be used in more than one language
implementation.</sentence> <sentence>This resulted in the Language Independent Garbage Collector
Toolkit, which offers very flexible generation scavenging with a variety of
write barrier (store check) implementations.</sentence> <sentence>This talk <speaker>will</speaker> present the design
of the toolkit, explain its sources of flexibility, and indicate where and how
the toolkit relies on the language implementation for language specific
support.</sentence> <sentence>The toolkit does not impose any particular format on heap allocated
objects, pointers, or stacks; nor does it mandate any specific approach to
implementing the write barrier.</sentence> <sentence>We have implemented the toolkit, and use it in
our Smalltalk implementation.</sentence> <sentence>We are currently building implementations of
Modula-3 and Standard ML using the toolkit.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Our approach requires accurate identification of pointers (versus non-pointer
quantities), and the ability to move objects.</sentence> <sentence>We have designed and implemented
the compiler extensions necessary to support accurate garbage collection in
the face of modern compiler optimizations for statically typed imperative
languages such as Modula-3.</sentence> <sentence>We have also devised a new technique called Mature
Object Space for insuring short collector pause times while guaranteeing
eventual collection of large generations, i.e., generations that cannot be
processed during one pause.</sentence> <sentence><speaker>Finally</speaker>, we have some performance measurements of
various write barrier implementations on a small suite of Smalltalk
benchmarks.</sentence> <sentence>Beyond presenting the toolkit, we <speaker><speaker>will</speaker> discuss</speaker> the compiler
extensions, mature object space, and the write barrier results as time
permits.</sentence></paragraph>

Darko Stefanovic.</sentence></paragraph>
