                              ISI

Current  programming  languages  are  monoliths: they generally
cannot be composed with one another and each presumes it is the
only  language  to  be  used for solving problems.  In order to
specify problem solutions in the <speaker>way</speaker> most suited to the problem
domain,   I   have  previously  <speaker>advocated</speaker>  the  use  of  `local
formalisms' --- languages designed by the  user  for  just  the
problem  at  hand.  In this talk, I describe tools which enable
monolithic  languages  to  be  broken  up  into   parameterized
component   sublanguages   and   recombined   with   a   user's
idiosyncratic language  to  solve  his  problem.    Hence,  the
creative activity can be localized to concerns with the problem
domain rather than the  supporting  language  fabric,  such  as
expressions, statements, and procedures.
