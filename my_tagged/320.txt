 TITLE:	  Control and Manufacturing Research and Education Programs
 	  at the National Science Foundation

Manufacturing is a highly integrative discipline and
manufacturing-related problems are among the most complex,
interdisciplinary problems faced by modern society.  <sentence>The National
Science Foundation (NSF) has encouraged university researchers to
build linkages with industry for manufacturing research and education,
in individual research projects, Engineering Research Centers, Science
and Technology Centers, and Engineering Education Coalititions.</sentence>  <sentence>As a
result, industry participation in manufacturing related university
proposals and university faculty participation in small business
research projects has steadily increased.</sentence>  <sentence>At the individual
investigator level, the GOALI (Grants Opportunity for Academic Liaison
with Industry) Program provides for Engineering Faculty Internship and
Industry-University Cooperative Research Projects.</sentence>  <sentence>The presentation
will discuss NSF programs to increase cooperation and cross
fertilization of ideas between control systems engineering and
advanced manufacturing technology.</sentence></paragraph>
