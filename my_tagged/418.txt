Causation, Feedback, Conditional Independence in Neural Nets, 
		and the Structure of the Unobserved

I <speaker>will describe</speaker> some recent work on automated causal inference done in
the last year  by <speaker>Peter Spirtes</speaker>, <speaker>Thomas <speaker>Richardson</speaker></speaker> and Richard <speaker>Scheines</speaker>,
extending the results in Spirtes, Glymour and <speaker>Scheines</speaker>, Causation
Prediction and Search, springer, <speaker>1993</speaker>.

In particular, I'll discuss as much of the following as I have time for:

1. <sentence>How causal relations among linearly related <speaker>unobserved variables may</speaker>
be determined from statistical patterns among their observed effects,
with limited prior knowledge.</sentence>(Spirtes and <speaker>Scheines</speaker>)

2. Statistical patterns characteristic of (convergent) linear feedback
systems (Spirtes)

3. Statistical patterns characteristic of many (convergent) non-linear
feedback systems (Spirtes, <speaker>Scheines</speaker>, <speaker>Richardson</speaker>, Glymour)

4. <sentence>Progress in characterizing statistically equivalent linear feedback
systems.</sentence> (<speaker>Richardson</speaker> and Spirtes)
