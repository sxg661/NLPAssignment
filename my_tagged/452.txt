 	in Higher Education

 ABST<speaker>R</speaker>ACT: <speaker>Not</speaker> since the introduction of chalkboards in the 1800s has
 the classroom been so challenged in regard to its basic design and
 pedagogical setting.  <paragraph><sentence>Neither overhead transparencies nor TV monitors
 provide the kind of dynamic, interactive capabilities seen on today's
 high resolution monitors.</sentence>  <sentence>Indeed, it is precisely the evolutionary
 symbiosis of powerful computers and good software that today provides
 the first real challenge to the traditional classroom setting.</sentence>  <sentence>The
 <speaker>presentation will discuss</speaker> all aspects of educational computing as it
is currently evolving: its history and context, issues of
instructional design and evaluation, technical support and
administrative advocacy, and the "computational turn" that is
affecting every academic discipline.</sentence>  <sentence>Concrete examples from <sentence><speaker>Dr</speaker>.</sentence></sentence>
<sentence>Cavalier's classes at <speaker>Carnegie Mellon will conclude</speaker> the presentation.</sentence>
<sentence>These examples include the use of interactive multimedia, a hypertext
syllabus to display and disseminate classroom materials, a
class-specific electronic bulletin board, and the potential
utilization of "Tele-profs" via network-based video mail.</sentence></paragraph>
