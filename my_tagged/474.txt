The Connection Machine Model CM-5 Supercomputer is a massively
parallel computer system designed to offer performance in the range of
1 teraflops ($10^{12}$ floating-point operations per second).  <paragraph><sentence>The
CM-5 obtains its high performance while offering ease of programming,
flexibility, and reliability.</sentence>  <sentence>The machine contains three
communication networks: a data network, a control network, and a
diagnostic network.</sentence>  <sentence>This talk <speaker>will describe</speaker> the organization of these
three networks and how they contribute to the design goals of the
CM-5.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>This work was done jointly with <speaker>Zahi S</speaker>.</sentence> <sentence>Abuhamdeh, <speaker>David C</speaker>.</sentence>  <sentence><speaker>Douglas</speaker>,
