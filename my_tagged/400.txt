                        7:15 - <etime>8:15 pm</etime>
                        4623 Wean Hall

                moderated locally by <speaker>Garth Gibson</speaker>

 ABSTRACT:  We often make decisions on the basis of very restricted
 information.  <paragraph><sentence>How are we then to measure the quality of such decisions?</sentence>
 <sentence>The <speaker>economist Leonard <speaker>Savage</speaker></speaker> proposed in the 1950's that the outcome of
 such on-line decisions be compared with the optimum outcome, achievable
 if complete information had been available.</sentence> <sentence>Recent research by computer
 scientists in on-line algorithms has shown the wide applicability of this
 idea.</sentence>  

<sentence>I am going to review on-line algorithms for terrain navigation and
exploration, compiling for parallel machines, and distributed optimization.</sentence>
<sentence>I shall also discuss how on-line algorithms can help determine the value of
information and improve the organization of the decision-making process.</sentence></paragraph>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This talk is the next in a series of live, interactive video conferences
that <speaker>will</speaker> be held every Wednesday 7 pm - <etime>8:30 pm</etime> between <speaker>January</speaker> 20 and
May 5 <speaker>1993</speaker>.  <paragraph><sentence>These conferences are being organized by a few <speaker>west coast</speaker>
schools, hence the name, the <speaker>West Coast Colloquium</speaker>.</sentence>  <sentence>This <speaker>will</speaker> be something
of a multiple university distinguished speakers series.</sentence>  <sentence>The participants,
so far, are <speaker>Berkeley</speaker>, <speaker>Stanford</speaker>, <speaker>Washington</speaker>, UCLA, UC San Diego, UC Santa
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>, and us.</sentence></paragraph>

<sentence>The technology is Picturetel based with conference bridging by AT&T.</sentence>  There
<speaker>will</speaker> be multiple monitors at each site;  cameras at every site are voice
activated to force the display to show that site, so that the distributed
audience can have camera time to ask questions.

<sentence>Wednesday's seminars are still experiemental.</sentence>  <sentence>Many sites have yet to
get all the equipment working for such an ambitious conference call.</sentence>
Even if everything is working well, there <speaker>will</speaker> be a noticeable lag
between your speech and its broadcast to your and others' monitors.
