Abstract: 

Prof <speaker>Patterson</speaker> has demonstrated classical "absent-minded
professor" symptoms.  <paragraph><sentence>The abstract posted a few days ago
is not the talk that he plans to give.</sentence>  <sentence>Instead, he appears
to be giving the talk we <speaker>saw</speaker> last spring in our Distinguished
Lecture <speaker>Series</speaker>.</sentence>  <sentence>It was good then, so if you missed it or
would like a reprise, come tomorrow evening.</sentence>    ----  garth

	         West Coast Computer Science Colloquium

		      Terabytes >> Teraflops
	Or why work on processors when I/O is where the action is?

			<sentence><speaker>David</speaker> A.</sentence> <speaker>Patterson</speaker>
	   Professor and Chair, Computer Science Division,
	  EECS Department, University of California, <speaker>Berkeley</speaker>

                        7:15 - <etime>8:15 pm</etime>
                        4623 Wean Hall
                (via Picturetel from <speaker>Berkeley</speaker>)
                moderated locally by <speaker>Garth Gibson</speaker>
[[[[[[  This is likely to be similar to the distinguished lecture given by
	<speaker>Patterson</speaker> here at CMU last spring.    ---  garth  ]]]]]]]

Amdahl's Law tells us with faster processors we
need faster and larger I/O. <sentence>Unfortunately disks are getting smaller rather
than faster.</sentence>  <sentence>This talk describes the results of the RAID project
(Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks), which offers much
greater performance, capacity, and reliablity from I/O systems.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>I <speaker>will</speaker> also talk about a new project getting underway called Sequoia 2000,
which looks at utilizing small helical scan tapes, such as
digital-audio tapes or video tapes, to offer terabytes of
storage for the <speaker>price</speaker> of a fileserver.</sentence> <sentence>(Sequoia 2000 is the Digital
Equipment Corporation funded successor to MIT's Project <speaker>Athena</speaker>;
it promises terabytes of economical and low latency storage
for global change scientists at the University of California.)</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>My thesis is that a factor of 1000 increase in storage capacity available
on most Ethernets <speaker>will</speaker> have a much greater impact than a factor of
1000 increase in processing speed for a gaggle of scientists.</sentence></paragraph>
