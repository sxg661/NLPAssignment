This talk describes an environment to derive efficient parallel
implementations from program specifications using stepwise 
refinement.  <paragraph><sentence>The environment is built around a data parallel
notation called UC.</sentence>  <speaker>Novel</speaker> aspects of UC include:

* support for the design of rapid prototypes 
* incremental refinements for efficiency via dynamic data 
  distributions and progressively weaker synchronizations
* portability across synchronous and asynchronous architectures
* simple control-flow constructs to ensure that correctness 
  proofs are no more complicated than for equivalent 
  sequential programs.

<sentence>A UC compiler is available for the CM-2; a sequential emulator 
for UC is also available and a multicomputer implementation 
is in progress.</sentence>  <sentence>Measurements of the UC compiler on selected 
numerical and <speaker>graph applications will</speaker> be presented.</sentence></paragraph>
