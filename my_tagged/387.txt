Large-scale knowledge-based machine translation requires significant
amounts of lexical knowledge in order to map syntactic structures to
conceptual structures. <paragraph><sentence>In my talk I <speaker>will</speaker> present a framework in which
lexical knowledge is separated into different levels of representation,
arranged in a hierarchical model based on principles of knowledge
representation and lexical semantics.</sentence> <sentence>The proposed methodology is
language-independent, and has been used to organize lexical knowledge
for both <speaker>English</speaker> and Japanese.</sentence></paragraph>

<sentence>I <speaker>will</speaker> give a brief overview of the principles of lexical semantics
and frame-based knowledge representation as they relate to lexical
structures for practical MT, and illustrate how the proposed framework
<speaker>will</speaker> be used in the KANT system to organize lexical entries and
mapping rules for large-scale applications.
