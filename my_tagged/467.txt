 Topic:     Algorithms for Square Roots of <speaker>G</speaker>raphs

The {\em kth power} of a graph  <speaker>G</speaker> = (<speaker>V</speaker>, E), written <speaker>G</speaker>^k,
is defined to be the graph having <speaker>V</speaker> as its vertex set with
vertices u, v adjacent in <speaker>G</speaker>^k if and only if
there exists a path of length at most k between them.
<paragraph><sentence>Similarly, graph H has a {\em kth root} <speaker>G</speaker> if <speaker>G</speaker>^k = H.
<speaker>Powers</speaker> of graphs have several interesting properties.</sentence>
<sentence>For example, the square of any biconnected graph and the
cube of any connected graph is hamiltonian.</sentence></paragraph>

In this talk, we present algorithms to find a square
root <speaker>G</speaker> of a graph <speaker>G</speaker>^2 for the following special classes of graphs:

	Find <speaker>G</speaker> given <speaker>G</speaker>^2, where <speaker>G</speaker> is a tree, in O(m) time.

	<paragraph><sentence>Find <speaker>G</speaker> given <speaker>G</speaker>^2, where <speaker>G</speaker>^2 is planar, in O(n) time.</sentence></paragraph>

	<paragraph><sentence>Find <speaker>G</speaker> given <speaker>G</speaker>^2, where <speaker>G</speaker> is a subdivided graph, in O(m n) time.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence><speaker>Finding</speaker> square roots of subdivided graphs is equivalent to inverting
total graphs.</sentence>
<sentence>In addition, we present several results on the complexity
of finding maximum cliques and hamiltonian cycles in powers of graphs.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>This is joint work with <speaker>Yaw-Ling Lin</speaker>.</sentence></paragraph>
