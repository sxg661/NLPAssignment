<speaker>HOW TO</speaker> FIX COMPUTERS
Usefulness, usability and productivity.

<speaker>Tom Landauer</speaker>
<speaker>Director</speaker>, Cognitive Science Research
Bellcore

In the last five years or so, many economists and associated pundits
have born much bad news about the effect of computers on productivity.
<paragraph><sentence>I'll show you the data, and conclude that things probably are just as
bad as they seem.</sentence></paragraph>

<sentence>Then we'll look for root causes and possible cures.</sentence> <sentence>The main problem is that
computer applications are of little help for improving the efficiency of the
routine mental work of the information economy, and have been improving too
slowly.</sentence> <sentence>The good news is that simple, cheap, empirical usability
evaluation and redesign can turn the situation around.</sentence> <sentence>Fairly compelling
evidence will be displayed.</sentence>
