 TITLE: FILTERS FOR IMAGE RESAMPLING

A common problem in image processing is resampling a raster image.
<paragraph><sentence>This task crops up when removing distortions from satellite images and
when performing texture mapping in computer graphics, for example.</sentence>
<sentence>Careful filtering must be done during resampling or the results <speaker>will</speaker>
appear blocky or show aliasing.</sentence>  <sentence>Traditionally, most research in
resampling has addressed special <speaker>case</speaker>s.</sentence>  <sentence>Often, the class of mappings
is restricted to be affine (translation, rotation, and scaling), in
which <speaker>case</speaker> the filter is space invariant.</sentence>  <sentence>Furthermore, filters are
often designed for interpolation (upsampling) only or decimation
(downsampling) only.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>In this talk, we develop a unified theory for image resampling filters,
which subsumes previous methods for affine mappings, interpolation, and
decimation.</sentence>  <sentence>The theory describes the space variant filter for
resampling a multidimensional signal according to an arbitrary mapping
without aliasing.</sentence>  <sentence>A simple, fast approximation technique employing
elliptical Gaussian filters <speaker>will</speaker> be demonstrated.</sentence></paragraph>

Refreshments Will be served by 3:15pm*
