 TITLE:   Systems Design of An Off Road Autonomous Navigator

This talk <speaker>will overview</speaker> the results to date for my PhD thesis in the area
of autonomous cross country navigation. <paragraph><sentence>The work investigates aspects of 
perception, planning, localization and control using the tools of complexity 
and dimensional analysis, experimentation, and simulation.</sentence> <sentence>Ideas that emerge
are implemented on the HMMWV at CMU on a proof of principle basis.</sentence> 
<sentence>The prototype has achieved unprecedented speeds of 15 km/hr and excursions of 
15 km on a local off-road test site.</sentence></paragraph>

 Perception:

 Complexity analysis leads to the conclusion that while the raw throughput
 requirement for the maintenance of safety is manageable, the traditional 
 non-adaptive range image processing approach wastes tremendous computational
 bandwidth. <paragraph><sentence>A simple active perception algorithm is introduced which 
 computationally stabilizes the sensor vertical field of view.</sentence> <sentence>It makes 20 mph 
 off road autonomy feasible and points to techniques that <speaker>may permit</speaker> real time 
 stereo perception on serial hardware.</sentence></paragraph>

 Planning:

 Investigation of the impact of latencies and limits on actuator response leads
 to a reformulation of planning in configuration space as feedforward 
 satisficingcontrol in actuation space. <paragraph><sentence>The traditional hierarchical 
 planner-controller architecture collapses into a multi-input, 
 multi-output feedforward controller which employs both somatic and 
 environmental feedback and which closes this loop at relatively high 
 update bandwidth.</sentence> <sentence>Steering feedforward, in particular, has been shown 
 to be crucial to reliable navigation above 5 mph on rough terrain.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>The talk <speaker>will overview</speaker> the subsystems of typical cross country navigators 
and point to the impact of high speed robust navigation on subsystem 
requirements.</sentence></paragraph>
