<paragraph><sentence>The goal of my talk is to help the CMU community understand what it
takes to keep an <speaker>R</speaker>&<speaker>D program alive</speaker>.</sentence>  <sentence>The <speaker>case study</speaker> is NASA's AI
program.</sentence>  <sentence>It is 10 years old and has grown from $2M/yr to $18M/yr, but
the road has been <speaker>rocky</speaker>, and the current outlook is <speaker>anything</speaker> but
clear.</sentence>  <sentence>My <speaker>job</speaker> is two-fold: to educate the <speaker>Washington bureaucracy</speaker> as
to what can and should be done so that they <speaker><speaker>will</speaker> place good</speaker> and useful
constraints on the program, and to propagate those constraints to
those who <speaker>carry</speaker> out the program and help them understand what the
constraints are and why they were made.</sentence>  <sentence>What are those constraints?</sentence>
<sentence>How have they changed over the years?</sentence>  <sentence>What does the near future look
like?</sentence>  <sentence>What roles have university researchers played in the program,
and what roles might they play in the future?</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>This <speaker>will</speaker> not be a technical talk.</sentence>  <sentence>I <speaker>will</speaker> describe some of the things
we have done successfully and unsuccessfully, in order to get across
some lessons learned in the past decade.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>There are some significant signs that the future <speaker>will</speaker> see different
approaches to getting research funding and <speaker>carry</speaker>ing out research in
universities.</sentence>  <sentence>I'll discuss those signs, and open things up to
interactive discussion.</sentence></paragraph>
