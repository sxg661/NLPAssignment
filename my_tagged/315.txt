 TITLE:	  Autonomous Interactive <speaker>Art</speaker>work  

In my first formal opportunity to introduce myself and my enterprise to
faculty and students in robotics, I <speaker>will</speaker> outline my interests and goals
as associate professor of <speaker>art</speaker> and robotics, a joint position between the
Dep<speaker>art</speaker>ment of <speaker>Art</speaker> and the Robotics Institute.  <paragraph><sentence>I'll discuss the
problematics and potentials of this radically interdisciplinary project:
attempting to make <speaker>art</speaker> with robotic technologies and techniques.</sentence>  I'll
briefly discuss my teaching practice in this area,  my class Robotic <speaker>Art</speaker>
Studio, as a <speaker>way</speaker> of elucidating some of these problematics. 

<sentence>The majority of the <speaker>seminar <speaker>will</speaker></speaker> be spent in discussing my current
autonomous robotic <speaker>art</speaker>work Petit Mal, both technically and
theoretically.</sentence> <sentence>Petit Mal, like most of my work, is a piece of
self-reflexive technology.</sentence> <sentence>It is made _of_ the technology which it seeks
to speak about,that is, robotics in general.</sentence> 

Through the process of building robotic <speaker>art</speaker>works I accrue a deeper
understanding, not just  of  robotic  technologies and techniques, but
of  the nature, function and aspirations of robotics as a discipline.
<sentence>Such projects also (implicitly and explicitly) question the nature of
<speaker>art</speaker>istic practice.</sentence>  

<sentence>It must be emphasized that complex interaction between people and
(digital) machines is an historically novel phenomenon.</sentence> <sentence>The motivations
for producing such a technology, and its potential cultural functions,
are a relatively unexplored subject, philosophically and aesthtically.</sentence>
<sentence>We have no ``aesthetics of interactivity.''</sentence>  <sentence>Through my <speaker>art</speaker>/research
practice I realize models of possible modes of interaction which have
cultural content.</sentence></paragraph>

<sentence>In my presentation I <speaker><speaker>will</speaker> engage</speaker> the issue of interactivity and the
technological interface in terms of ``representation,'' in terms of the
(generally implicit) body of knowledge which the user brings to an
interface in order to be able to understand and use it.</sentence> <sentence>In p<speaker>art</speaker>icular
I'm interested in Petit Mal as an experimental realization of an
autonomous agent inhabiting real space, the <speaker>way</speaker> in which its ``meaning''
is formulated by the user/viewer in the process of interpreting its
behavior.</sentence> 

I look forward to the  exchange of ideas that might arise in discussion
of these issues.
