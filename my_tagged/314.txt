 Title: Learning to Understand Information on the Internet.

<paragraph><sentence>The explosive growth in the number and diversity of information
sources on the Internet is rapidly outstripping our ability to find
what we want.</sentence>  <sentence>Browsers and Indexing tools are practical, but only
partial, solutions to this problem.</sentence>  <sentence>A number of information gathering
agents have emerged.</sentence>  <sentence>However, because such agents require a
programmer to hand code a model of each information source in their
repertoire, they too are victims of information explosion.</sentence>  <sentence>This talk
explores automatically learning models of information sources as a
possible solution.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>I <speaker>will describe ILA</speaker>, a domain-independent program that learns the
meaning of external information by explaining it in terms of internal
categories.</sentence>  <sentence>In one experiment, ILA starts off with knowledge of local
faculty members, quickly learns a model of the Internet service WHOIS,
and then bootstraps to learn models of the personnel directories
available at <speaker>Berkeley</speaker>, <speaker>Brown</speaker>, <speaker>Cal-Tech</speaker>, <speaker>Cornell</speaker>, Rice, Rutgers, and
UCI.</sentence>  <sentence>ILA's hypothesis language is first-order conjunctions, and its
bias is compactly encoded as a determination.</sentence>  <sentence>I introduce a
probabilistic model of ILA that bounds its sample complexity, and show
when this bound is tighter than the famous Haussler bound.</sentence></paragraph>

This talk is based on joint work with Mike Perkowitz

<speaker>Professor Etzioni</speaker> will be at <speaker>CMU <speaker>March</speaker></speaker> 6, 7 and 8th.  If you would like an
appointment with him on Monday, <speaker>March</speaker> 6, please send mail to plp@cs, or call
x8-7897 (<speaker>Phyllis</speaker>).
