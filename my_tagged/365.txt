 Title: 	MULTIPLE-MODEL MACHINE VISION

Images are fundamentally inhomogeneous, yet most machine vision work has
been based on homogeneous processing using a single type of image model.  <paragraph><sentence>We
have developed a framework for inhomogeneous, multiple-model machine vision
using a Minimum Description Length (MDL)/Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)
selection criterion.</sentence>  <sentence>I <speaker>will</speaker> talk about how we have applied this framework
to the problem of multiple-object structure/egomotion from uncalibrated
video, and the problem of object recognition using 2-D aspect models.</sentence></paragraph>
