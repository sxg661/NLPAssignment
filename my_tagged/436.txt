HCI Seminar

Programmable Applications for Scientists and Artists

University of Colorado, Boulder

Wednesday, March 23
Wean Hall 5409
3:30-5pm 
Programmable applications are software systems that combine the
learnability and accessibility of direct manipulation interfaces with
the expressive range of "domain-enriched" programming environments.
While -- broadly speaking -- the notions of direct manipulation and
programming have historically been viewed as existing in opposition,
programmable applications seek to blend language and direct
manipulation constructs in mutually supportive ways. <paragraph><sentence>This talk <speaker>will</speaker>
describe some of the issues that <speaker>arise</speaker> in the design of programmable
applications, and <speaker>will</speaker> present two prototype applications (based on
the Scheme programming language) for the domains of graphic design and
computational physics.</sentence></paragraph>
