 LabSpace:  Developing the National Electronic Laboratory Infrastructure

The LabSpace project integrates emerging multiuser virtual
environment technology with state of the <speaker>art multimedia interfaces</speaker> in
order to support scientific collaboration.  <paragraph><sentence>The resulting networked
environment, composed of a persistent collection of objects and a
flexible history mechanism, allows the creation of electronic virtual
laboratories.</sentence>  <sentence>These <speaker>virtual laboratories will</speaker> be networked locations
where <speaker>scientists will interact</speaker> with analytical electron microscopes,
high energy physics experiments and data, and, most importantly, each
other.</sentence>  <sentence>The <speaker>LabSpace project will</speaker> develop the tools to create these
virtual laboratories and the scientists' interfaces, and will
validate these integrated tools in two end-user testbeds.</sentence></paragraph>
