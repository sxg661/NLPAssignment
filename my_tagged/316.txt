 <speaker>AARON</speaker>: In <speaker>Living Color</speaker>.

<paragraph><sentence>During the past four years, work on the <speaker>AARON</speaker> program has been directed
primarily to giving it the ability to color its own drawings, and most
recently to providing it with a painting machine with which it could do
so in the real world.</sentence> 

<sentence><speaker>Harold Cohen</speaker> discusses some of the issues that have arisen in this
task; for example, the problem of mapping the results of working in
a three-color additive system to a real world n-color subtractive 
system.</sentence> <sentence><speaker>AARON</speaker> makes its debut in color at the Computer Museum in <speaker>Boston</speaker>
on <speaker>April</speaker> 1, and Cohen assesses the degree to which the task has been 
accomplished.</sentence></paragraph>
