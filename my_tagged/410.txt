ARGUMENT AND ARBITRATION GAMES

We begin with two points about modeling reasoning that <speaker>Herbert Simon</speaker>
and <speaker>Nicholas Rescher</speaker> made well, but which were lost in the AI shuffle:

resource-bounded process; 2) dialectic is one of the right kinds of
process.  <paragraph><sentence>A protocol for disputation is essentially a model of an
automated reasoner's search procedure.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>We describe programs and card games which model case-based legal
argument and reasoned settlement.</sentence></paragraph>
