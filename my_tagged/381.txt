 TITLE:	Research in Teleoperated and Cooperative Control 
 	of Free-Flying Space Robots

The MIT Laboratory for Space Teleoperation and Robotics (L<speaker>STAR</speaker>) is involved in the study of free-flying space robotic vehicles for performing extravehicular assembly, servicing, and repair.  <paragraph><sentence><speaker>L<speaker>STAR</speaker>'s</speaker> experimental activities include both neutral-buoyancy and virtual-environment experiments that target the human-robot teleoperator interface, as well as cooperative, automatic control systems that work to aid the human operator.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence><speaker>L<speaker>STAR</speaker>'s</speaker> neutral-buoyancy robot, <speaker>STAR</speaker>, was designed to be serviceable, reliable, and flexible.</sentence>  <sentence>In order to support experiments combining human and automatic control, <speaker>STAR</speaker> is equipped with a real-time vision-based control system that has been used to demonstrate high-quality real-time control of <speaker>STAR</speaker>'s position and orientation at a simulated worksite.</sentence>  <sentence><speaker>STAR</speaker> has also been equipped recently with a three-degree-of-freedom manipulator arm to support 
experiments in teleoperator positioning dexterity as well as simple, autonomous fetch-and-return experiments.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence><speaker>L<speaker>STAR</speaker>'s</speaker> virtual-environment system is designed to focus on the remote-vision systems used by a remote-vehicle operator to sense and control the vehicle's position and orientation in its environment.</sentence>  <sentence>It is able to simulate teleoperation of vehicles functioning in two or three dimensions, with a variety of vehicle dynamics and visual environments.</sentence>  <sentence>It supports both fixed-monitor and helmet-mounted displays, with or without simulated head-tracking of the remote cameras.</sentence>  <sentence>Its primary current function is to 
study the use of sophisticated head-tracking stereoscopic camera 
systems and helmet-mounted displays, and to find ways to improve operator perception and control of vehicle motion using such systems.</sentence></paragraph>
