 TITLE:  Product Design for Environmental Compatibility

There is a growing interest in making products environmentally more
compatible.  <paragraph><sentence>While there is a need to make products and processes less toxic,
to increase recyclability, and to reduce waste; we have to try to achieve
environmental friendliness without compromising product quality.</sentence>  <sentence>This
approach to design has come to be called @i(Green Engineering Design).</sentence>  <sentence>The
aim is to identify, develop, and exploit new technologies that can bolster
productivity without costing the environment.</sentence>  <sentence>The idea is to inject concerns
about environmental friendliness into the design process, where the assessment
of environmental friendliness is based on a life-cycle view of the product.</sentence>
<sentence>This includes the product's manufacturing process, distribution, use, and
final disposal.</sentence></paragraph>

<sentence>We <speaker>will</speaker> examine a two part approach to green engineering: (1) the development
of special @i(green indicators) - measures of environmental
compatibility, and (2) tools that use the green indicators to help designers
assess, compare, and make design decisions.
