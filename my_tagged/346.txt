 Title:		Neural net models of lightness and <speaker>color constancy</speaker>.

	<sentence>One of the key problems in vision is segmentation of images into 
	labeled patches that represent features, surfaces and objects in the
	scene.</sentence>  <sentence>Analytical models for delineating and labeling surfaces as
	white, black, grey or color regardless of variation in intensity or
	hue of the illuminant remain a matter of controversy.</sentence>  <sentence>Computational
	neuroscience allows test of the compatibility between physiological
	data and computational theories of lightness and <speaker>color constancy</speaker>.</sentence>  <sentence>We
	present here a quantitative investigation of luminance and color 
	contrast processing using computer based models of neural networks 
	derived from the anatomy and physiology of these visual functions.
