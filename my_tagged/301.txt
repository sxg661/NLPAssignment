 TITLE: AN ASYNCHRONOUS TEAM SOLUTION TO SCHEDULING STEEL PLANTS
        IN DIRECT HOT CHARGE MODE

In this talk, I <speaker><speaker>will</speaker> address</speaker> the problem of direct hot charge scheduling of steel rolling mills in the primary steel making area (continous caster and hot strip mill). <paragraph><sentence>The work involved scheduling a huge order book (of approximately 5000 orders) with the objective of minimizing the operating costs, tardiness and inventory.</sentence> <sentence>This is a combinatorial problem due to complex constraints built into it.</sentence></paragraph>

	<paragraph><sentence>We proposed an asynchronous team solution for this domain.</sentence> <sentence>The intial schedules were generated by two different construction algorithms whose performance on the objective function was different from each other.</sentence> <sentence>I <speaker>will</speaker> present some preliminary results which show significant improvements in the evaluation costs when the above designs are integrated in the framework of ATeams.</sentence></paragraph>

<sentence>This research was carried out at IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center over the summer of 1994.</sentence> This work was performed jointly with  Dr.Sesh Murthy of IBM.
