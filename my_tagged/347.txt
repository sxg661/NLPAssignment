<speaker>Abstract</speaker>: 

 Title:			Computer vision and geometric measurement

 Visitor/Speaker:	<speaker>Dr</speaker>. Kam W. <speaker>Wong</speaker>
 			Professor of Civil Engineering
 			University of <speaker>Illinois</speaker> at Urbana-Champagne

 Date:			Friday, March 20th

Seminar time:		3:30-4:30, <location>Adamson Wing</location>, Baker Hall
			(Refreshments served at 3:15)
Some of the fundamental problems associated with the use of computer vision
systems for fully <speaker>automated geometric measurements will</speaker> be discussed,
 including: geometric distortion characteristics of vision systems, methods
 of geometric calibration, target identification and centroiding, model
 integration, and surface modeling.  <paragraph><sentence>A vision system that has been developed
 to measure the shape, volume, and surface area of <speaker>human bodies will</speaker> be used
 as the focus for discussion.</sentence></paragraph>
