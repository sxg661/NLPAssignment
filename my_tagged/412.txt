University Teaching Center
Seminars Series for Graduate Students
"Managing Current Courses, Anticipating Future Roles"

<speaker>ABOUT THE</speaker> SERIES

"Managing Current Courses, Anticipating Future Roles" is a weekly series of
interactive seminars designed for graduate students.  On a pilot basis for
1993-94, the Teaching Center <speaker>will</speaker> offer several  in-depth, three-week
modules and several one-session special topics on different aspects of
college teaching and learning.  

<sentence>The modules provide an opportunity for sustained discussion of selected
topics because we ask you to make a commitment to attend 3 or 4 related
sessions.</sentence>  <sentence>This format allows you to try some different strategies and then
discuss how they worked with other participants.</sentence>  <sentence>Also, for some modules we
<speaker>may</speaker> ask you to bring some sample materials from your discipline so that the
applications can be most useful to you.</sentence>  <sentence>The special topic format allows you
to sample a combination of topics based on your interest in different types
of students, course formats, or teaching styles.</sentence>  

<sentence>To facilitate discussion each session <speaker>will</speaker> have no more than 20
participants.</sentence>  <sentence>Some of the sessions <speaker><speaker>may</speaker> break</speaker> into smaller groups to
accommodate the interests of people in different disciplines.</sentence>  <sentence>Experienced
TAs, faculty, and administrators <speaker>will</speaker> be present to facilitate discussion at
several sessions.</sentence>  

<sentence>You should pre-register for sessions of interest to you by using the form
included in this program description, or by contacting Michelle
Gregg-Rassau, at x2896 or mg2e@andrew.cmu.edu.</sentence>  <sentence>Please note that the
locations for Spring 1994 seminars <speaker>will</speaker> be announced at a later date.</sentence>  If
you have questions about these seminars,  please <speaker>contact Rea Freeland</speaker>,
