Vectorization techniques have proved to be extremely effective
for large-scale reservoir simulations.  <sentence>Parallel capabilities
hold even greater potential for these enormous problems.</sentence>  <sentence>Domain
decomposition methods can allow the physical problem to be divided
up into many similar problems that can be addressed separately,
in parallel, on different processors.</sentence>  <sentence>These techniques also allow
efficient application of local grid refinement to resolve the
important local phenomena that <speaker>may govern</speaker> the flow process.</sentence>
<sentence>Eulerian-Lagrangian methods that follow the flow also can profit
extensively from parallel treatment of the characteristics of the
flow.</sentence>  The effectiveness of these techniques <speaker>will</speaker> be demonstrated
on research codes and illustrative applications.
