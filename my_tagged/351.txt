 TITLE:		Antarctic Exploration Robotics

CMU's <speaker>DANTE</speaker> robot will soon explore an active volcano in Antarctica. 
<paragraph><sentence><speaker>DANTE</speaker> is a remote geologist and a harbinger of polar and planetary robots.</sentence> 
<sentence>The exploration objective of the project is to study the gas from the lava 
lake.</sentence> <sentence>The robotics objectives of this program are to navigate the extreme 
terrain of the crater walls, and to operate in harsh conditions.</sentence> <sentence>The 
technical challenges include perception, locomotion and mission 
performance in planet-like conditions.</sentence> <sentence>The system envisioned for 
this exploration includes a novel walking robot, camera and scanner 
vision, scientific sampling devices, remote interfaces and a satellite 
data link for live feedback to the US.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>This seminar profiles the technical challenges with progress and 
approaches that address them.</sentence> <sentence>Examples include a new laser range 
scanner for terrain modeling, non-contact foot sensing and mechanics 
for combining the tension of a climbing rope with the motions of a 
walking robot.</sentence> <sentence>A lab visit following the presentation provides the 
opportunity to view results to date.</sentence></paragraph>
