I <speaker>will describe</speaker> our research in automating the kinematic <speaker>analysis</speaker> of
rigid part mechanisms, such as gears, cylinder locks, clutches, and
transmissions.  <paragraph><sentence>Kinematic <speaker>analysis</speaker> determines the constraints on the
behavior of a mechanism imposed by the shapes of its parts and by the
contacts among them.</sentence>  <sentence>Automating the <speaker>analysis</speaker> is an important step
toward automating the overall design and <speaker>analysis</speaker> of mechanisms.</sentence>  <sentence>The
computational complexity of kinematic <speaker>analysis</speaker> depends on the shapes
and motion types of the parts of the mechanism, and is in general
intractable.</sentence>  <sentence>We have identified engineering restrictions on part
shapes and interactions that make kinematic <speaker>analysis</speaker> feasible.</sentence>  <sentence>Most
mechanisms belong to the feasible class according to a survey of 2500
mechanisms in a standard mechanical engineering encyclopedia.</sentence>  <sentence>We have
developed an efficient kinematic <speaker>analysis</speaker> program for feasible
mechanisms.</sentence>  <sentence>The program derives the motion of the parts for given
input motions and internal forces, such as gravity and friction.</sentence>  <sentence>It
uses a simple model of dynamics that captures the steady-state effect
of forces without the conceptual and computational cost of traditional
dynamical simulation.</sentence>  <sentence>It generates a compact, symbolic behavioral
description and a realistic, three-dimensional animation.</sentence>  <sentence>It can also
generate the space of behaviors for all possible input motions.</sentence></paragraph>
