Abstract: 

This talk is the next in a series of live, interactive video conferences
that <speaker>will</speaker> be held every Wednesday 7 pm - <etime>8:30 pm</etime> between <speaker>January</speaker> 20 and
May 5 <speaker>1993</speaker>.  <sentence>These conferences are being organized by a few <speaker>west coast</speaker>
schools, hence the name, the <location>West Coast Colloquium</location>.</sentence>  <sentence>This <speaker>will</speaker> be something
of a multiple university distinguished speakers series.</sentence>  <sentence>The participants,
so far, are <speaker>Berkeley</speaker>, <speaker>Stanford</speaker>, <speaker>Washington</speaker>, UCLA, UC San Diego, UC Santa
<speaker>Barbara</speaker>, and us.</sentence>
<sentence>The technology is Picturetel based with conference bridging by AT&T.</sentence>  There
<speaker>will</speaker> be multiple monitors at each site;  cameras at every site are voice
activated to force the display to show that site, so that the distributed
audience can have camera time to ask questions.

<sentence>Wednesday's seminars are still experiemental.</sentence>  <sentence>Many sites have yet to
get all the equipment working for such an ambitious conference call.</sentence>
<sentence>Even if everything is working well, there <speaker>will</speaker> be a noticeable lag
between your speech and its broadcast to your and others' monitors.
