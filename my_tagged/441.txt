   HEWLETT-PACKARD PRESENTS:
   "A FREE OBJECT TECHNOLOGY TELECAST/SEMINAR"

   Cyert Hall Room 100 - WEDNESDAY, <speaker>MAY</speaker> 11, 1994
                         11:00-5:00 EST
          "BUILDING THE ENTERPRISE THROUGH OBJECT TECHNOLOGY"

* Increase Competitiveness
* Increase Maintainability
* Enjoy Flexibility in Application Functionality
* Learn about Advances in Technology
* Gain Productivity through Reuse
* Reduce Costs

To gain the competitive advantage in today's rapidly
changing business environment, you need to respond
quickly to the market opportunities.  <paragraph><sentence>Through object
technology you can provide the flexibility needed for
this market.</sentence>  <sentence>Objects enable firms to deliver proprietary
software solutions rapidly as well as integrate the
entire operation with a client/server architecture.</sentence>
<sentence>Hewlett-Packard can offer you a clear path to
object-based computing through products, programs,
consulting, and solutions that are available today.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>LEARN FIRST HAND.</sentence>
<sentence>Hewlett-Packard <speaker>will</speaker> broadcast through NTU (National Technology
University) a special event focusing on object-oriented technology.</sentence>
<sentence>This <speaker>telebroadcast <speaker>will</speaker></speaker> feature key speakers from HP Laboratories as
well as commercial examples of how an object technology is used in
the telecommunications and financial industries.</sentence></paragraph>

Here are highlights of what you'll be hearing from some of the
 speakers:

 <speaker>Joel S</speaker>. <speaker>Birnbaum</speaker>, Ph.D
 Senior Vice President of Research and Development
 <speaker>Director</speaker>, Hewlett-Packard Laboratories

<speaker>Dr</speaker>. <paragraph><sentence><speaker>Birnbaum</speaker>'s talk <speaker>will</speaker> set the stage for the rest of the NTU
broadcast.</sentence>  He <speaker><speaker>will</speaker> discuss</speaker> how the first beneficiaries of
object technology <speaker>will</speaker> be software developers;  objects help
manage complexity, encourage reuse, and lead to better, more
maintainable code. <sentence>The promise of object technology is that
software designed to match the <speaker>way</speaker> people think <speaker>will</speaker> be easier
to use and more useful.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence><speaker>Jeff <speaker>Eastman</speaker></speaker>, Ph.D.</sentence>
Consulting Engineer, Hewlett-Packard
Software Engineering Systems Division

<speaker>Dr</speaker>. <sentence><speaker>Eastman</speaker> is the chief architect of HP's Distributed
Smalltalk.</sentence>  His <speaker>presentation <speaker><speaker>will</speaker> discuss</speaker></speaker> how distributed
systems are inherently object-oriented;  thus, it is natural to
use object technology in their design and implementation.  <sentence>The
Object Management Group's Common Object Request Broker
Architecture (CORBA) is a set of emerging industry standards for
the construction of object-oriented distributed systems and
applications.</sentence>  <sentence>This talk <speaker><speaker>will</speaker> assess</speaker> the state-of-the-art in the
CORBA arena and provide an architectural framework for
discussing distributed computing systems.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence><speaker>Mary E</speaker>.S.</sentence> Loomis, Ph.D.
<speaker>Director</speaker>, Software Technology Lab
Hewlett-Packard Laboratories

<speaker>Dr</speaker>. <sentence>Loomis has over 20 years' experience in software engineering
and data management.</sentence>  <sentence>Her presentation <speaker>will</speaker> focus on object
database management systems (ODBMS).</sentence>  <sentence>Topics include: sources of
object persistence, architectures of ODBMS products, extended
relational and language bound, object model support, distributed
functionality, and standards and technical directions.</sentence></paragraph>

<speaker>Derek <speaker>Coleman</speaker></speaker>
Manager, Software Reuse Department
Hewlett-Packard Laboratories

<speaker>Mr. <speaker>Coleman</speaker></speaker> is a co-author of "Object-oriented Development:  the
Fusion Method," published by Prentice-Hall.  <paragraph><sentence>Fusion is an
object-oriented method that was developed to meet the needs of
HP's large and diverse software engineering community.</sentence>  <sentence>The
presentation <speaker>will</speaker> explain the Fusion method and its underlying
rationale.</sentence>  <sentence>The talk <speaker>will</speaker> also present HP's experiences
introducing Fusion into actual use on live projects.</sentence>  <sentence>His
<speaker>presentation <speaker>will</speaker> conclude</speaker> with a status report on <speaker>CASE tools</speaker>
and current research.</sentence></paragraph>

Real world examples:

In addition to these specialized presentations, the telecast
<speaker>will</speaker> feature industrial colleagues presenting how their use of
object technology and object-oriented development tools greatly
enhanced their application development process.
