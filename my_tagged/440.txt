We report about projects and activities in parallel computing at CSCS'
Section of Research and Development (<speaker>SeRD</speaker>). <paragraph><sentence>The {\em Joint CSCS-ETH/NEC
High Performance Computing Software Development Center} is a
collaboration with NEC Corporation comprising ten full-time scientists
working in a user- and <speaker>application-driven way</speaker> on tools for
parallelization support, performance monitoring, and debugging, as well
as applications and algorithms for distributed memory parallel
processor systems (DMPPs).</sentence> <sentence>Another project, {\em A Tool Environment
for Parallel Programming of Distributed Systems} is funded by the Swiss
National Science Foundation in the framework of the Swiss Priority
Program Informatics (SPPIF).</sentence>  <sentence>It's long-term research goal is to build
a problem solving environment for convenient programming of DMPPs.</sentence> <sentence>The
environment is founded on a specification-level formalism tailored to
the needs of computational scientists and successfully addresses the
issues of performance, portability, extensibility and software reuse.</sentence>
<sentence>CSCS' {\em Summer Student Internship Program} (SSIP), for the first
time carried through in the summer of <speaker>1993</speaker>, transforms the research and
development results into the educational sector.</sentence>  <sentence>CSCS' Parallel
Computer Systems and Education Laboratory (ParEdLab) provides a
framework for education and training on novel computer architectures
and software systems, knowledge acquisition in the field of
high-performance computing, and consultation of academic institutions
and industrial and commercial companies.</sentence></paragraph>
