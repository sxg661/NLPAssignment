                    Interconnect Analysis via Passive Circuit Synthesis

                                                    <speaker>J. <speaker>Eric Bracken</speaker></speaker>

	Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in the creation of
low-order models to represent the behavior of linear interconnect
circuits. <paragraph><sentence>Through approaches such as asymptotic waveform evaluation
(AWE) and Pade' approximation, it is possible to efficiently compute a
simple macromodel of a complicated interconnect.</sentence> <sentence>This macromodel can be
combined with nonlinear driver and receiver models to accelerate the
analysis of the circuit's responses.</sentence></paragraph>

	<paragraph><sentence>One problem with Pade' approximation is that it <speaker>may generate unstable</speaker>
results.</sentence> <sentence>These instabilities arise because the macromodel actually
represents an active, energy-producing network.</sentence> <sentence>It would be better for
an interconnect model to be totally passive, never generating energy on
its own.</sentence> <sentence>In this talk, we discuss the instability problem by appealing
to certain classical techniques of passive circuit synthesis.</sentence> <sentence>It is
shown that AWE is mathematically equivalent to the development of a
ladder circuit that realizes the Pade' approximation in virtual
"hardware."</sentence> <sentence>For certain classes of circuits and certain pairs of
input/output responses, the ladder realization consists entirely of
positive-valued circuit elements; as a consequence, it is guaranteed to
be passive and stable.</sentence></paragraph>

	<paragraph><sentence>The conditions under which Pade' approximation can be expected to
produce stable results <speaker>will</speaker> be discussed.</sentence> <sentence>Also, the limitations of Pade'
approximation <speaker>will</speaker> be described: for certain types of circuits and
responses, there is simply no guarantee that stable results can be
found.</sentence> <sentence>To overcome these problems, it is necessary to replace Pade'
approximation by other efficient algorithms for finding low-order
models.</sentence> <sentence>Fortunately, the notion of synthesizing a passive model can be
extended to more general classes of circuits.</sentence> <sentence>We <speaker><speaker>will</speaker> conclude</speaker> the talk
by describing some promising new approaches to interconnect analysis
based upon this idea.</sentence></paragraph>
