                          HEURISTIC SEARCH REVISITED

In  the  history of research on thinking two (or more) distinct traditions have
persisted.  One tradition, deriving from the study of language and logic, views
thinking  as  a form of logical and verbal reasoning.  The other, deriving from
the study of human problem solving, views thinking as a  process  of  heuristic
search  through  a mental representation of a problem situation.  The talk <speaker>will</speaker>
use recent findings from research on  human  thinking  to  review  the  present
status and future prospects within A.I. <sentence>of these two paradigms.
