Part 1:
- Sentences and paragraphs

Part 2:
- Write a function that takes the name of the text file and retrieves its ID (from the title?)
Wordnet:
- Find a way to detect the ontology of multi-word topics (such as "Hydraulic presses")
	- need to assign the first synset!
	- need to change the hyper_loop function to account for this change!
- Find a way to search the rest of the text if the topic isn't successfully detected in the "Topic" part of the announcement email (might not need to do it if I can detect multi-word topics?) -- probably relatively easy
